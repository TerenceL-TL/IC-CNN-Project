*This project aims to perform brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scans.* Given a 3D brain MRI volume, the code identifies the tumor region and generates a segmented 3D volume representing the tumor. The segmented tumor volume is then saved for furtyyyher analysis or visualization.

### Dataset

The project requires a dataset of 3D brain MRI scans with corresponding tumor labels. The dataset should include both training and testing subsets. The training data should consist of 3D MRI volumes along with their corresponding tumor segmentation masks. The testing data should only include 3D MRI volumes without any associated tumor labels, [Download from here in from.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14zKQUPBzSBLkY4o4Oxdtxx93YXCUu50U?usp=sharing)
### Step by Step guide


1. **Prepare the dataset:** 

Organize the 3D brain MRI scans with their corresponding tumor segmentation masks, program can handel data in the following forms.


.nii.gz. In the case of .nii.gz you need to have a folder named 'dataset_segmentation' and the app will create the data inside Train and Val directories.

.npy if you have the slices and masks in the form of numpy you need just to put them in the folders Train and Val



Ensure that you have right organization of data insicde the foders so that it can be properly labeled.
Train: contains training Data and contains two folders mask and image
Val: contains validation data and have only image folder, Mask will be generated by the progr

1. **Convert Data**
am.

2. **Launch the code:** after ensuring that you have the libraries ready Run the `brain_tumor_segmentation.py` script.

4. **Train the segmentation model:** Use the provided training data to train the model. The model will learn to identify the tumor region based on the input MRI scans and their corresponding tumor labels.

3. **Vsualize the result:** Customize the script's configuration parameters to suit your needs. These parameters may include file paths, network architecture, training settings, etc.

5. **Apply the model to testing data:** Use the trained model to predict the tumor segmentation for each testing sample. The testing data should contain 3D MRI volumes without tumor labels.

6. **Save segmented tumor volumes:** Save the segmented tumor volumes as 3D images in a suitable format (e.g., NIfTI). These volumes can be used for further analysis, visualization, or integration into medical imaging software.

## Results

The project aims to provide accurate tumor segmentation results on 3D brain MRI scans. The quality of the results may vary depending on factors such as the dataset size, image quality, model architecture, and training parameters.
